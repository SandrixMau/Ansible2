Instead of creating a yaml file we can just pass the details in a command. So for example
we want to test connectivity to hosts via Ansible, a yaml file will look like:

---
- name: Ping servers
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - ping:

And run the file (please note this will not perform a ping, it will test if ansible is able to ssh to the servers).
- So we can use the module ping:

# ansible -m ping all

Or add the command directly:

# ansible -a 'cat /etc/hosts' all

-Gather facts of localhost:
# ansible -m setup localhost

-Run an adhoc command to perform a ping connectivity to all hosts in the /home/thor/playbooks/inventory file:
# ansible -m ping -i /home/thor/playbooks/inventory all

-Run an adhoc command to run a command on host web1 to print the date:
# ansible -m command -a date -i inventory web1
