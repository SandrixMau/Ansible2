-Ansible control machine can only be a Linux machine not a Windows one, there are some
workarounds for it but are not officially supported. However Windows machines can
be targeted by Ansible.
-To install ansible on ubuntu apt-get install ansible on centOs yum install ansible
If python is alredy installed use  pip install ansible.
For the exam is on centOs and for not to get conflict with the versions we should install
it with pip, for that we should:
yum install epel-release
yum install python-pip
pip install ansible

To just upgrade ansible:
pip install --upgrade ansible

Install specific version of Ansible:
pip install ansible==2.4

DISTRIBUTE SSH KEYS

-SSH to manage nodes, so we generate keys:
ssh-keygen
add public key on the remote server under:
cat /home/.ssh/authorized_keys
access remote:
ssh -i id_rsa user@server
Or we can copy the key:
ssh-copy-id -i id-ras user@server

-To test connectivity to the managed nodes
Use the ping module to test connectivity through Ansible - ansible -m ping -i inventory web1
