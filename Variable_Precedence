Variable Precedence

ansible_host will be an variable, and it can be defined in different places
within our hosts file. the dns_server variable is applicable to all hosts
:

/etc/ansible/hosts

web1 ansible_host=172.20.1.100
web2 ansible_host=172.20.1.101

[web_servers]
web1
web2

[web_servers:vars]
dns_server=10.33.1.1

If we specify the dns for a particular hosts, ansible takes the variable at the host level first, if none it will take the one at the group level,
so in this case web2 will take dns_server=10.33.1.3 and web1 dns_server=10.33.1.1. So that's what is called variable precedence, host level takes precedence
over the variable defined over the group level:

/etc/ansible/hosts

web1 ansible_host=172.20.1.100
web2 ansible_host=172.20.1.101 dns_server=10.33.1.3

[web_servers]
web1
web2

[web_servers:vars]
dns_server=10.33.1.1

If in the playbook we have a different value for the dns_server, this one overrides the variable in the host and group level.

we can even run an extra variable when running the playbook, this case takes the highest precedence:

ansible-playbook myplay.yml --extra-vars "dns_server=10.33.1.4"
