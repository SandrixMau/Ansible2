Create a playbook httpd.yml under ~/playbooks directory to make sure httpd service is started on web1 node.

---
- name: Start httpd
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Start httpd service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: true

We have a playbook ~/playbooks/file.yml to copy a file with a welcome message under httpd server root on web1 node.
Make changes in playbook so that httpd server reloads after copying the file, make sure it does not restart the httpd server.
---
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Copy Apache welcome file
      copy:
        src: index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
    - service:
        name: httpd
        state: reloaded

We would like the httpd service on web1 node to always start automatically after system reboot. Update the httpd.yml playbook you created earlier with the required changes.
---
- name: Start httpd
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Start httpd service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: true

We created a playbook ~/playbooks/config.yml to enable port 443 for httpd on web1 node as we do want to run nginx on default port 80 so port 80 needs to be free.
Make changes in playbook so that httpd service restarts after making change.

---
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Make changes in Apache config
      replace:
        path: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
        regexp: "^Listen 80"
        replace: "Listen 443"

    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted

Create a playbook ~/playbooks/nginx.yml to install nginx on web1 node and make sure nginx service is started and should always start even after system reboot.

---
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start and enable Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
