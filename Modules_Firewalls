Using an Ansible playbook install firewalld on web1 node, start and enable its service as well. Name the playbook as firewall.yml and keep it under ~/playbooks.

- hosts: web1
  tasks:
   - yum: name=firewalld state=installed
   - service: name=firewalld state=started

We have a requirement on web1 node to white list web2 node's IP address 172.20.1.101 in firewall. Create and run a playbook ~/playbooks/whitelist.yml to do so.
Add IP in internal zone.

- hosts: web1
  tasks:
   - firewalld:
      source: 172.20.1.101
      state: enabled
      zone: internal
      permanent: yes
      immediate: yes

We want to block 161/udp port on web1 node permanently. Make a playbook block.yml under ~/playbooks/ directory to do so.
Use zone: block

On web1 node add firewall rule in internal zone to enable https connection from Ansible controller machine and make sure
that rule must persist even after system reboot. You can create a playbook https.yml under ~/playbooks/ directory.
IP address of ansible controller is 172.20.1.2.

- hosts: web1
  tasks:
    - name: Enable HTTPS for ansible controller
      firewalld:
        source: 172.20.1.2
        service: https
        zone: internal
        state: enabled
