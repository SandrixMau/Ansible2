Privilege escalation is the rights that a user has on the nodes.
In order for a user to escalate those privileges it needs to become super user,
so it can use sudo, but also this can be done using pfexec, doas, ksu, runas.
It can also become another user like for example 'su anotheruser'.

In ansible to become sudo add this to the playbook or to the inventory file or in the ansible.cfg:
# become: yes

If we want to use another method just add:
#become_method: doas
or
#become_user: anotheruser

If variables present in all the files the inventory file overrides the variables in the config file,
the ones in the playbook overrides the ones in the inventory file, if pass on the command line those
overrides everything else.

to be prompted for sudo password on command line add:
# --ask-become-pass
