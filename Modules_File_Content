Create a playbook ~/playbooks/perm.yml to create a blank file /opt/data/perm.txt with 0640 permissions on web1 node.

---
- name: Create file perm.txt
  hosts: web1
  tasks:
   - name: Create file perm.txt
     file: path=/opt/data/perm.txt mode=0640 state=touch

Using a playbook ~/playbooks/index1.yml create /var/www/html/index.html file on web1 node with content This line was added using Ansible lineinfile module!.

We have a playbook ~/playbooks/find.yml that recursively find files in /opt/data directory older than 2 minutes and equal or greater than 1 megabyte in size
and also copy that files under /opt directory. However it has some missing parameters so its not working as expected, take a look into it and make appropriate changes.

---
- hosts: web1
  tasks:
    - name: Find files
      find:
        paths: /opt/data
        age: 2m
        size: 1m
        recurse: yes
      register: file

    - name: Copy files
      command: "cp {{ item.path }} /opt"
      with_items: "{{ file.files }}"

In /var/www/html/index.html file on web1 node add some additional content using blockinfile module. Below is the content:
Welcome to KodeKloud!
This is Ansible Lab.
Make sure user owner and group owner of the file is apache also make sure the block is added at beginning of the file. Create new playbook for this ~/playbooks/index2.yml

---
- name: Add block to index.html

       Welcome to KodeKloud!
       This is Ansible Lab.

On web1 node we want to run our httpd server on port 8080. Create a playbook ~/playbooks/httpd.yml to change port 80 to 8080 in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
file using replace module. Also make sure Ansible restarts httpd service after making the change.
Listen 80 is the parameter that need to be changes in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

---
- name: replace port 80 to 8080
  hosts: web1
  tasks:
  - replace:
      path: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
      regexp: 'Listen 80'
      replace: 'Listen 8080'
  - service: name=httpd state=restarted
