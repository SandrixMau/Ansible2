-The conf files of ansible by default are in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg where we can
see the route of the inventory, log files, modules, time to wait for an ssh attempt,
how many hosts ansible can target at the same time, enable plugins....

--Overide default parameters. Sometimes we have multiple playbooks but we don't want to run the same conf files
  for all of them, for example we want an extented time for ssh on some of the playbooks,
  for that we need to copy the conf file and added into the playbook directory and modify it.
  Another way to do it, in case we want one conf file to be used wih different playbooks
is to pass the conf file as an environment variable like:
  $ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/opt/ansible-web.cfg ansible-playbook playbook.yml

  If we have both ways configured, the first one to take will be the environment variable,
  those override any other files, followed by the file in the current directory,then the
  one in the users home directory (.ansible.cfg) and then the one in the default location

  - We can also make use of the default conf file but only override one parameter, for example
    gathering = explicit, we just add ansible and put it in upper case (however check the
    documentation to be sure). ANSIBLE_GATHERING=explicit.
so to apply it to just one execution or playbook:
  ANSIBLE_GATHERING=explicit ansible-playbook playbook.yml
If we want to persist this change on the shell session:
  export ANSIBLE_GATHERING=explicit
  ansible-playbook playbook.yml

To make the change persistent across all the shells and users:
  create a copy of the conf in the playbooks directory and update the parameter
