Under ~/playbooks/ directory create a playbook create_vg.yml to create a new VG called vg_sql. The playbook should only run on node node00.
Use the PV /dev/vdb1 for the VG

---
- hosts: node00
  tasks:
  - name: create VG
    lvg:
      vg: vg_sql
      pvs: /dev/vdb1

Under ~/playbooks/ directory create a playbook create_lvol.yml to create a new logical volume called lv_data. The playbook should only run
on node node00. Use the VG vg_sql for the VG. Size of the LVM should be 500MB

---
- hosts: node00
  tasks:
    - name: create logical volume
      lvol:
        vg: vg_sql
        lv: lv_data
        size: 500M

Create a playbook called create_fs.yml. The playbook should create a new filesystem on the logical volume lv_data on node00. Create this playbook under ~/playbooks directory.
fstype = ext4 dev: /dev/vg_sql/lv_data

---
- hosts: node00
  tasks:
  - name: create filesystem
    filesystem:
      fstype: ext4
      dev: /dev/vg_sql/lv_data

Create a playbook called create_mount.yml. The playbook should only run on node00 and mount the newly created filesystem /dev/vg_sql/lv_data on the directory /mnt/data.
Create this playbook under ~/playbooks directory.
src = /dev/vg_sql/lv_data name = /mnt/data fstype = ext4 state = mounted

---
- hosts: node00
  tasks:
  - name: mount fs
    mount:
      name: /mnt/data
      src: /dev/vg_sql/lv_data
      fstype: ext4
      state: mounted

Lets now combine the tasks from all previous questions in to one. Create a playbook called storage_setup.yml under ~/playbooks. The playbook should make use of the same
Volume Group we created as part of Question 2 called vg_sql. It should then create a new logical volume called mssql_db, size 1G, an ext4 filesystem on this device and
mount it on /mnt/mssql on the node00 alone.

---
- hosts: node00
  tasks:
    - name: create logical volume
      lvol:
        vg: vg_sql
        lv: mssql_db
        size: 1G

- hosts: node00
  tasks:
  - name: create filesystem
    filesystem:
      fstype: ext4
      dev: /dev/vg_sql/mssql_db

- hosts: node00
  tasks:
  - name: mount fs
    mount:
      name: /mnt/mssql
      src: /dev/vg_sql/mssql_db
      fstype: ext4
      state: mounted
